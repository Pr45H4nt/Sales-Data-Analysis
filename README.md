# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data to answer important business questions about sales performance, customer behavior, and product preferences. Using Python, `pandas` was employed for data processing, and `matplotlib` for visualizing the results, making insights more accessible and actionable.

## Questions Addressed

The analysis in this project answers the following questions:

1. **What was the best month for sales, and how much revenue was earned?**
2. **Which city had the highest number of sales?**
3. **What is the best time for advertisement?**
4. **Which product was sold the most?**
5. **What products are frequently bought together?**

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.

## Project Structure

The main sections of the project are:

- **Data Loading**: The sales data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values and irrelevant data are handled to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Key questions are answered through data aggregation, filtering, and manipulation.
- **Data Visualization**: Results are visualized using matplotlib to make insights easier to interpret.

## Analysis Summary

Each question was answered as follows:

1. **Best Month for Sales**: Determined the month with the highest revenue.
2. **City with Highest Sales**: Identified the city with the most number of sales.
3. **Best Time for Advertisement**: Analyzed the time of day with the highest sales to suggest optimal advertisement timing.
4. **Most Sold Product**: Found the product with the highest sales volume.
5. **Frequently Bought Together Products**: Identified combinations of products often bought together.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd sales-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the analysis notebook**.

## Visualizations

All questions are supplemented with visualizations, including:

- **Monthly Sales Revenue**: A bar chart showing the monthly revenue.
- **City Sales**: A bar chart showing sales volume per city.
- **Sales by Hour**: A line chart to identify the best times for advertisements.
- **Product Sales Volume**: A bar chart indicating the most popular products.
- **Frequently Bought Together**: A barchart showing product pairs frequently purchased together.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into sales data that can guide business decisions, such as optimal advertisement timing, high-demand locations, and popular products. The code is organized to be reusable for similar datasets and can be expanded to include more complex analysis.
